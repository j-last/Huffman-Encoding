This was an exploration into Huffman encoding after it was mentioned in one of my seminars.

I saw this as a good opportunity to improve my Java skills before a formative assessment, as it's a relatively simple task that involves lots of different programming techniques and data structures, such as implmenting a priority queue, implementing a binary tree and using a HashMap (which I had not previously used in Java).

I'm happy with how this turned out as it felt like this is actually applicable to the real-world (something which is often lacking in computer science 'problems').
If I were to do this again I would improve how I wrote the docstrings for methods, write docstrings for the classes and structure my code differently to make the code more re-usable (such as using an interface of a binary tree that the HuffmanTree class would then implement.
